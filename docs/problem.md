## Problem

Many existing POS systems are overly complex for small retail businesses.

Instead of reducing human error, they rely heavily on manual actions
such as selecting promotions or pricing options.
This makes the final price dependent on the cashier’s decision,
not on actual product quantity.

When stores hire staff, this complexity becomes a real problem.
Mistakes are easy to make, difficult to track,
and often discovered only after money is already lost.

The problem becomes even worse when inventory is involved.
Stock numbers may look correct in the system,
but do not reflect real-world movement between warehouse and store.

This project starts from a simple question:
why should a system ask humans to think,
when it can calculate correctly by itself?
