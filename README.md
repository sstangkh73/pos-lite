# pos-lite

A minimal POS core system focused on automatic pricing logic and stock consistency for small retail businesses.

## Why this project exists
Most small retail POS systems rely too much on manual promotion selection.
This increases human error, especially when stores hire staff.

This project explores a simpler approach:
pricing should be a result of actual quantity, not manual options.

## Scope
This project intentionally focuses only on core logic:
- Automatic price calculation based on quantity
- Stock in / stock out consistency
- Separation between store stock and warehouse stock

Everything else is out of scope for now.

## Non-goals
- Complex promotion systems
- Fancy UI
- Enterprise-level features
